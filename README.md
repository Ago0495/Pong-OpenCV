# OpenCV-Based Pong

Ball trajectory tracking and prediction

## Description

A computer vision software system capable of tracking a ball in a game of Pong and autonomously moving a paddle to interact with the ball. 
Computer vision techniques will be used to track the ball's movement on the screen and control one of the paddles to intercept the ball and beat the player.

## Objectives
Interpret the screen from the game environment and send it to the algorithm
Detect current location of the ball
Predict the trajectory of the ball
Calculate the input needed to move the AIâ€™s paddle to the correct location
Interpet the input needed and send it to the game environment
Beat the player
